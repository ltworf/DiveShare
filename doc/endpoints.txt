diveshare is a website to store and display dives for multiple users.

Dives are uniquely identified by their dive_id, which is a numeric id.

Dives can be private or public. If they are private they will never appear in
"related dives" lists, but they can still be shared using their dive_id.

Related dives
=============
Dives are related if they are performed using the same divecomputer or if they
belong to the same user.

Users
=====
Dives can belong to a user or be anonymous. If a dive belongs to a user, it will
be listed in the "My Dives" page of that user, and only that user will be able
to delete it.

Private dives that don't belong to any user could be deleted.

Upload dives
============

```
curl -XPUT http://server/upload?private=true -T file.js
```

Returns lines containing the dive_id, the dive_delete_id and the title separated
by a comma.

Lines are \n separated, with a trailing \n

The "X-UID" header can be used to associate the dives
directly.

The value of the header must be the string returned to
the user visiting "/secret", after authentication.

Associate dives
===============

```
curl -XPOST http://server/associate?dives=123,345,515,13123
```

This endpoint associates the dives with the currently logged user.

The numbers in the parameters are dive_id comma separated.

For it to work the user must be logged in already, or it fails.

If you call this with a GET, it will present the user with a login form if not
logged, and then show a button that has to be clicked to perform the POST.


Delete dives
============
```
curl -XDELETE http://server/delete/dive/dive_delete_id
```

or

```
curl -XPOST http://server/delete/dive/dive_delete_id
```

The 2nd one returns HTML, the first one doesn't.

In both cases, 200 is success and 404 is if the
dive_delete_id was not valid

Dive profile
============
/profile/dive_id

Returns the SVG of the dive profile.

Optionally it is possible to pass ?width=123&height=100



Privacy
=======
Do not ever upload something that you wouldn't want to see spread all over the
internet. This is a good general rule.
